<h1>latent semantic analysis via the singular value decomposition</h1>

<p>
following on from some <a href="http://matpalm.com/rss.feed/">previous work</a> on classifying documents i wanted
to see how well <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis">latent semantic analysis (lsa)</a> does at classifying documents.
</p>

<h2>wha?</h2>

<p>
usually when comparing documents we do so using the fundamental unit of the text; the actual terms themselves.</br>
lsa gives a way of comparing documents at a higher level than the terms by introducting a concept called the <em>feature</em>.</br>
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">singular value decomposition (svd)</a> is a way of extracting features from documents.
</p>

<h2>an example</h2>

<p>
lets go through a high level example to help build the initution.
</p>

<p>
first let's introduce the <em>term occurance matrix</em>, a common way to describe a corpus, where rows represent terms and columns represent documents.</br>
element a<sub>i,j</sub>=n denotes that the i<sup>th</sup> term occured n times in the j<sup>th</sup> document.
</p>

<p>
consider the, extremely contrived, documents...
<pre>
d1: modem the steering linux. modem, linux the modem. steering the modem. linux!
d2: linux; the linux. the linux modem linux. the modem, clutch the modem. petrol.
d3: petrol! clutch the steering, steering, linux. the steering clutch petrol. clutch the petrol; the clutch.
d4: the the the. clutch clutch clutch! steering petrol; steering petrol petrol; steering petrol!!!!
</pre>

which is represented as the 6x4 document term matrix (colour introduced just to help see patterns)
</p>

<p>
<table>
<tr> <td></td> <td>d1</td> <td>d2</td> <td>d3</td> <td>d4</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>linux</td> <td class="y">3</td> <td class="y">4</td> <td class="w">1</td> <td class="x">0</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>modem</td> <td class="y">4</td> <td class="y">3</td> <td class="x">0</td> <td class="w">1</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>the</td> <td class="y">3</td> <td class="y">4</td> <td class="y">4</td> <td class="y">3</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>clutch</td> <td class="x">0</td> <td class="w">1</td> <td class="y">4</td> <td class="y">3</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>steering</td> <td class="w">2</td> <td class="x">0</td> <td class="y">3</td> <td class="y">3</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>petrol</td> <td class="w">0</td> <td class="x">1</td> <td class="y">3</td> <td class="y">4</td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
straight away we can see that, based on what words the documents contain, that doc1 and doc2 are alike and doc3 and doc4 are alike
</p>

<p>
the terms <em>linux</em> and <em>modem</em> are used a lot in the first two docments and one can imagine that they are representive of a concept; we could call it <em>computers</em></br>
the terms <em>clutch</em>,  <em>steering</em> and <em>petrol</em> are used a lot in the last three documents, perhaps they are representive of a concept; we could call it <em>automotive</em></br>
the term <em>the</em> is an interesting one; it used across all the documents and we can see that this is not really related to either topic but is more an english construct</br>
</p>

<p>
lsa will help up extract these features, <em>computers</em> and <em>automotive</em>, in some form.</br>
but alas won't give us nice human readable names for them :)
</p>

next let's look at <a href="eg1.html">an example of svd</a>
