Despite the fact that the building is dedicated to four-wheelers, there are actually more motorcycles there than cars. That's alright with us, as the bikes on display are some of the coolest machines that history has to offer. Starting with some of the earliest cycles powered by rudimentary engines , it's easy to see just how far we've come in just about one-hundred years or so of mass production. Take a gander at some of the first motocross bikes , land speed record racers , rotary-powered cycles, modern choppers and scooters (including one from Harley-Davidson ) in our gallery below. Our personal fave? That would be the 1951 Vincent Black Shadow . Gallery: San Diego Auto Museum Motorcycles ? Permalink | Email this | Comments 
http://www.autoblog.com/rss.xml|Mon, 01 Sep 2008 03:33:00 +1000|Filed under: Sports/GTs , Supercars , Spyker , Special/Limited Editions Take your exotic sports car and put it in a room with its racing counterpart. Put on some R&B, dim the lights and wait nine months. It's a winning formula that has worked for some of the world's best automakers and resulted in such stunning performance vehicles as the Ferrari 430 Scuderia, Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera, Aston Martin DBS and Porsche 911 GT3 RS, to name just a few. Now Spyker is getting ready to cue up the Barry White with the upcoming LM 85. Named for the starting position of the Spyker C8 GTR2 racer at Le Mans, the LM 85 will be the latest race-derived, hardcore exotic sportscar. It will be based on the short-wheelbase C8 Laviolette, but lightened and tightened. Power could be as high as 450 horses, while the suspension is expected to be stiffened and weight removed to get a 0-100 km/h (0-60 mph) figure near 3.8 seconds and top speed bumping the 300 km/h (186 mph) mark. Only a highly symbolic 24 examples are expected to be built in an effort to bring the niche Dutch automaker back from the brink. [Source: Auto Motor und Sport and Motor Authority ] ? Read ?|?

http://www.autoblog.com/rss.xml|Mon, 01 Sep 2008 01:47:00 +1000|Filed under: Spy Photos , Sedans/Saloons , Geneva Motor Show , Rolls-Royce The RR4 -- the Rolls-Royce that asks that you "don't call me 'baby'" -- is slowly undressing, striptease-like, before its final reveal at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. Previous spy shots hinted at rear suicide doors, or coach doors as Rolls-Royce refers to them, and now it is official: the hinges on the rear door are on the rear of the door. The car has plenty of Phatom-esque cues, and although it doesn't look anything like the initial sketch , it looks like it could be a very attractive proposition when it shows up for the big dance. Still no word on engines, but we have no doubt its output will be something along the lines of prodigious. Thanks for the tip, Andrus! [Source: Global Motors ] ? Read ?|?

The fractional bit of additional horsepower didn't mean much to him, but he did say the brakes were more capable, and, surprise, the car is quite wide and people like to stare at it. After six hours on Italy's B-roads, that basically sums up his impressions. Since he didn't have too much to say in print, we really do hope he's saving the zingers for the show...

http://www.autoblog.com/rss.xml|Sun, 31 Aug 2008 22:09:00 +1000|Filed under: Motorsports , Etc. , Euro , Audi , UK Click above for a gallery of David Sutton's rally car collection In the eighties, the late David Sutton owned the company that prepared rally cars for Audi UK. It turns out he was collecting cars at the same time as he was preparing them, and putting them in his Historic Motors Ltd museum. The assortment includes seven Audis, some of which are Group B monsters, as well as an RS200 Cosworth, a couple of Lancias, a 1944 Volvo, and even a Skoda. Now the lot's being sold, 22 cars in all, through Morris & Welford . It's the kind of collection that, even if you had the time, money, and connections, would probably take you years to assemble individually. But you can have it all, right now... if you have what is likely to be an enormous sum of cash. Check out the other items on offer in the gallery below.

http://www.autoblog.com/rss.xml|Sun, 31 Aug 2008 20:26:00 +1000|Filed under: Etc. , Videos Follow the jump to watch "One Cab's Family" Judging by your comments, watching "Susie the Little Blue Coupe" yesterday brought back memories for many of you. Another thing that became very apparent is that you also hold Tex Avery's 1952 short, "One Cab's Family" in extremely high regard, and commenter "raf 280z" stuck a link to it in the thread. Like Susie, the Cab family's story is an endlessly re-watchable classic. Mom and Dad taxi welcome their adorable little boy into the family garage (note the wallpaper border inside -- one of many great touches), but as junior gets older, he gets a little rebellious, and trouble follows -- big trouble. So, grab your kids, sit back and enjoy it after the jump. "Nurse, check his oil, fill 'im up with gas and we'll take him home!"

The sports car race is back this year as the ninth round of the American Le Mans Series. For those who have never checked out an ALMS race, it's one of the best and most exciting forms of motorsport anywhere. Highcroft Racing's Acura ARX-01B captured the pole and led much of the first half of the race ahead of the De Ferran Racing Acura. If you TiVoed the race and don't want to ruin the surprise, you can just check out the gallery and come back later to see the full results after the jump. Otherwise, you know what to do.

http://www.autoblog.com/rss.xml|Tue, 02 Sep 2008 04:58:00 +1000|Filed under: Geneva Motor Show , Aston Martin Lagonda is set to celebrate its 100th anniversary next year. But while enthusiasts are bound to celebrate by recalling Lagondas of yore, Aston Martin plans to give us all something more tangible to commemorate by reviving the long-dormant marque. (Truth be told, having been founded in 1906, Lagonda marked its centenary two years ago already. But we're not going to let some simple facts get in the way of a good story, now are we?) The British automaker produced luxury cars independently until 1947 when it was bought by Aston Martin. Although Aston used the Lagonda name as a model designation from 1976 to 1989 for a quirky angular four-door, with a handful of coachbuilt specials and concept cars in between, the last model Lagonda produced was the 1961-65 Rapide, a nameplate which Aston is also revived with its upcoming four-door coupe model, previewed by the 2006 concept in Detroit . While the production Rapide is expected to continue as an Aston Martin, the company is planning a unique concept car to be unveiled at the Geneva show next March that will show the way forward for the rejuvenated marque. While Aston has not confirmed what form the vehicle, which could hit the streets as soon as 2012, will take, they've reportedly ruled out the possibility of a sport-ute. Sources suggest a new competitor aimed at Bentley and Rolls-Royce, although the Longonda will be more focused on performance than long distance cruising. No telling what that will mean for Aston's partnership with Mercedes-Benz, which has its own failing Maybach brand competing in the segment as well. However the resuscitation of Lagonda is bound to form a vital component of Aston Martin's ambitious growth plan. (Press release after the jump.)

http://www.autoblog.com/rss.xml|Tue, 02 Sep 2008 03:54:00 +1000|Filed under: Convertibles , Sports/GTs , Videos , Supercars , Ferrari Click above to watch the video So far the only video footage we've seen of the new Ferrari California has been either computer animated or sitting still with a giant chin talking . But the fellas over at Autocar magazine in the UK made their way down to Maranello with video cameras in tow for an up-close-and-personal with the newest Prancing Stallion. After the jump you'll find some focus-changing fun angles of the new California, as well as a brief interview with product development director Roberto Corradi, who amusingly informs us that the car was made easier to drive and more softly styled to accommodate female customers. Seriously. Check it out after the jump ... it's good for a laugh. [Source: Autocar ] Continue reading VIDEO: Ferrari California is easy to drive... you know, for the ladies ? Read ?|?
